Cancellation Policy

Orders can be cancelled within 12 hours of placement without any penalty.

Once an order has been shipped, it cannot be cancelled.
Customers must instead follow the return process as outlined in the Refund Policy.

If an order is cancelled successfully before shipment, a full refund will be issued to the original payment method within 3–5 business days.

The company reserves the right to cancel orders in cases of:
- Pricing errors
- Suspected fraudulent activity
- Stock unavailability
